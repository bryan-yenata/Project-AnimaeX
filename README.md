# Project AnimaeX
Project AnimaeX is a game created for the Foundations of Game Design and Development course.

Project AnimaeX is a Super Smash Bros. inspired game that is aiming to do improve the SSB formula, while also adding new features that might make the game feel different, while also maintaining the beloved SSB gameplay formula.
This game follows the purpose of SSB, which is to combine the different characters from different game universes (Nintendo and non-Nintendo). 

Instead of using game characters, we are using Anime and Cartoon (Animation) characters, hence the name "AnimaeX". AnimaeX is the combination of Anim**a**tion and Anim**e**, with X meaning the cross between the two worlds.
